  abstract = {Efficient methodologies for mapping croplands are an essential condition for the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices and for monitoring crops periodically. The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of globally available satellite images, such as those provided by Sentinel-2, creates new possibilities for generating accurate datasets on available crop types, in ready-to-use vector data format. Existing solutions dedicated to cropland mapping, based on high resolution remote sensing data, are mainly focused on pixel-based analysis of time series data. This paper evaluates how a time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) method that uses Sentinel-2 time series performs when applied to pixel-based and object-based classifications of various crop types in three different study areas (in Romania, Italy and the USA). The classification outputs were compared to those produced by Random Forest (RF) for both pixel- and object-based image analysis units. The sensitivity of these two methods to the training samples was also evaluated. Object-based TWDTW outperformed pixel-based TWDTW in all three study areas, with overall accuracies ranging between 78.05\% and 96.19\%; it also proved to be more efficient in terms of computational time. TWDTW achieved comparable classification results to RF in Romania and Italy, but RF achieved better results in the USA, where the classified crops present high intra-class spectral variability. Additionally, TWDTW proved to be less sensitive in relation to the training samples. This is an important asset in areas where inputs for training samples are limited. [Display omitted] •Time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) was evaluated for croplands mapping•Object-based TWDTW performed better than pixel-based TWDTW•TWDTW is robust in areas where inputs for training samples are limited•Automatic time-series Sentinel-2 data segmentation produced satisfactory results•Sentinel-2 proved to be a valuable satellite data source for croplands mapping},

  abstract = {Due to the atmosphere effect, the qualities of images decrease conspicuously, practically in the visible bands, in the processing of earth observation by the satellite-borne sensors. Thus, removing the atmosphere effects has become a key step to improve the qualities of images and to retrieve the actual reflectivity of surface features. An atmospheric correction approach, called ACVSS (Atmospheric Correction based Vector Space of Spectrum), is proposed here based on the vector space of the features' spectrum. The reflectance image of each band is retrieved first according to the radiative transfer equation, then the spectrum's vector space is constructed using the infrared bands, and finally the residual errors of the reflectance images in the visible bands are corrected based on the pixel position in the spectrum's vector space. The proposed methodology is verified through atmospheric correction on Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery. The experimental results show that our method is more accurate and the corrected image is more distinct, compared with those offered by current popular atmospheric correction software.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Current estimates of forest degradation are associated with large uncertainties. However, recent advancements in the availability of remote sensing data (e.g., the free data policies of the Landsat and Sentinel Programs) and cloud computing platforms (e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)) provide new opportunities for monitoring forest degradation. Several recent studies focus on monitoring forest degradation in the tropics, particularly the Amazon, but there are less studies of temperate forest degradation. Compared to the Amazon, temperate forests have more seasonality, which complicates satellite-based monitoring. Here, we present an approach, Continuous Change Detection and Classification - Spectral Mixture Analysis (CCDC-SMA), that combines time series analysis and spectral mixture analysis running on GEE for monitoring abrupt and gradual forest degradation in temperate regions. We used this approach to monitor forest degradation and deforestation from 1987 to 2019 in the country of Georgia. Reference conditions were observed at sample locations selected under stratified random sampling for area estimation and accuracy assessment. The overall accuracy of our map was 91\%. The user's accuracy and producer's accuracy of the forest degradation class were 69\% and 83\%, respectively. The sampling-based area estimate with 95\% confidence intervals of forest degradation was 3541~±~556~km2 (11\% of the forest area in 1987), which was significantly larger than the area estimate of deforestation, 158~±~98~km2. Our approach successfully mapped forest degradation and estimated the area of forest degradation in Georgia with small uncertainty, which earlier studies failed to estimate. •A method, CCDC-SMA, is presented for monitoring temperate forest degradation.•Sensitivity of fraction of endmembers is different in different types of forest.•Using different SMA-based indices in different types of forest improves accuracy.•High accuracy is achieved on the area estimates of forest degradation.•Forest degradation is more widespread than deforestation in Georgia (country).},

  abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is a central parameter for surface urban heat island (SUHI) studies, in which thermal remote sensing plays a key role. Traditionally, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), percent green vegetation (\%GV), and percent impervious surface area (\%ISA), have been widely applied to examine the impacts of land cover compositions on SUHI. Urban thermal pattern, however, is a complicated physical phenomenon involving a series of environmental factors, and it is insufficient to employ only one indicator for the explanation of the SUHI phenomenon. Therefore, considering different thermal properties of various land cover compositions, this study proposed a two-step physically based method, the spectral unmixing and thermal mixing (SUTM) model, to examine the impacts of typical land cover compositions on urban thermal pattern. The performance of SUTM was compared with those of linear and non-linear (quadratic) regression models with NDVI, \%GV, and \%ISA as individual independent variables. Results indicate that SUTM outperforms all regression models, with the lowest root mean square error (2.89K) and mean absolute error (2.11K). Moreover, when the accuracy was assessed at five interval levels of percent impervious surface area, it indicates that SUTM performs consistently well in both rural and urban areas. Comparatively, NDVI and \%GV-based regression models perform well in rural areas, but poor in urban areas, whereas \%ISA-based models perform well in urban areas, but relatively poor in rural areas. This study found that soil, including both moist and dry soil, has significant impacts on modeling SUHI. ► We model surface urban heat island by a spectral unmixing and thermal mixing method. ► Abundance and thermal properties of various land compositions are considered. ► Results are compared with regression models using NDVI and land cover abundances. ► This method outperforms regression models with NDVI and land cover abundances. ► Moist and dry soil have significant impacts on modeling surface urban heat island.},

Numerous studies have proposed LST retrieval algorithms for the Landsat series, and some datasets are available online.

Moreover, atmospheric disturbances can strongly compromise the accuracy of the results. The authors present a complete procedure for the identification and exploitation of stable natural reflectors or permanent scatterers (PSs) starting from long temporal series of interferometric SAR images. When, as it often happens, the dimension of the PS is smaller than the resolution cell, the coherence is good even for interferograms with baselines larger than the decorrelation one, and all the available images of the ESA ERS data set can be successfully exploited. On these pixels, submeter DEM accuracy and millimetric terrain motion detection can be achieved, since atmospheric phase screen (APS) contributions can be estimated and removed. Examples are then shown of small motion measurements, DEM refinement, and APS estimation and removal in the case of a sliding area in Ancona, Italy. ERS data have been used.},

Here we describe improvements made to the fire detection algorithm and swath-level product that were implemented as part of the Collection 6 land-product reprocessing, which commenced in May 2015. The updated algorithm is intended to address limitations observed with the previous Collection 5 fire product, notably the occurrence of false alarms caused by small forest clearings, and the omission of large fires obscured by thick smoke. Processing was also expanded to oceans and other large water bodies to facilitate monitoring of offshore gas flaring. Additionally, fire radiative power (FRP) is now retrieved using a radiance-based approach, generally decreasing FRP for all but the comparatively small fraction of high intensity fire pixels. We performed a Stage-3 validation of the Collection 5 and Collection 6 Terra MODIS fire products using reference fire maps derived from more than 2500 high-resolution Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images. Our results indicated targeted improvements in the performance of the Collection 6 active fire detection algorithm compared to Collection 5, with reduced omission errors over large fires, and reduced false alarm rates in tropical ecosystems. Overall, the MOD14 Collection 6 daytime global commission error was 1.2\%, compared to 2.4\% in Collection 5. Regionally, the probability of detection for Collection 6 exhibited a \textasciitilde 3\% absolute increase in Boreal North America and Boreal Asia compared to Collection 5, a \textasciitilde 1\% absolute increase in Equatorial Asia and Central Asia, a \textasciitilde 1\% absolute decrease in South America above the Equator, and little or no change in the remaining regions considered. Not unexpectedly, the observed variability in the probability of detection was strongly driven by regional differences in fire size. Overall, there was a net improvement in Collection 6 algorithm performance globally. •We describe the Collection 6 (C6) MODIS fire detection algorithm.•We globally validated the Collection 5 and Collection 6 Terra MODIS fire products.•The C6 false alarm rate was much lower in Equatorial Asia and NH South America.•The probability of detection for C6 increased significantly in boreal regions.•Overall, there was a net improvement in C6 performance globally.},

The objective is to utilize GEE, coupled with Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and Landsat 9 imagery, for precise remote sensing analysis, flood mapping, and Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification. The study employs a comprehensive methodology within the GEE platform, involving the acquisition and preprocessing of Sentinel-1 SAR data to create pre- and post-flood images. The difference between these images is calculated to generate flood maps at five-day intervals, providing a temporal evolution of the flood extent. Additionally, LULC mapping is conducted using Landsat 9 data, contributing to an understanding of pre-flood landscape characteristics. The results and discussion reveal significant impacts on various LULC types, with barren rocks, dense and medium forests, settlements, and agricultural lands experiencing notable effects. This research not only enhances our understanding of GLOFs but also serves as a critical tool for informing disaster management strategies, emphasizing the importance of accurate hazard assessment and the need for holistic approaches to mitigate the cascading effects of such events.},

  abstract = {This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of Google Earth Engine (GEE) in mapping floods and their aftermath, focusing on the recent event caused by cloud burst rainfall and glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) of Lhonak glacier lake in the Teesta River basin, North Sikkim. The objective is to utilize GEE, coupled with Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and Landsat 9 imagery, for precise remote sensing analysis, flood mapping, and Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification. The study employs a comprehensive methodology within the GEE platform, involving the acquisition and preprocessing of Sentinel-1 SAR data to create pre- and post-flood images. The difference between these images is calculated to generate flood maps at five-day intervals, providing a temporal evolution of the flood extent. Additionally, LULC mapping is conducted using Landsat 9 data, contributing to an understanding of pre-flood landscape characteristics. The results and discussion reveal significant impacts on various LULC types, with barren rocks, dense and medium forests, settlements, and agricultural lands experiencing notable effects. This research not only enhances our understanding of GLOFs but also serves as a critical tool for informing disaster management strategies, emphasizing the importance of accurate hazard assessment and the need for holistic approaches to mitigate the cascading effects of such events.},

  abstract = {Defining landscape structure and key relationships between landscape structure and function is challenging in urban areas characterized by density and patchy spatial patterns. In order to trace the spatial and temporal patterns of urban landscape structures, compare patterns across cities, or inform urban design principles, we need to classify the landscape in a way that captures context and landscape heterogeneity, but can be broadly applied across different cities or landscape variations within a city. In this study, we introduce a simple and reproducible approach for classifying the structure of urban landscapes (STURLA) that utilizes heterogeneous, composite classes which represent combinations of built and natural features, and examine the response of a landscape function – surface temperature. This classification approach is unique in that it develops composite (as opposed to homogeneous) classes, which are defined a posteriori, based on compositions of adjacent structural elements that emerge in the urban landscape, using a cellular grid to define units of analysis. We test the separability of classes that emerge from this approach, and find that it is possible to discern classes – comprised of the mix of land and building covers common in urban areas – which have meaningfully distinct temperature signatures. This classification approach may be extended to multiple cities and ecological indicators in order to offer insight into the relationship between urban landscape structure and ecosystem response, in a way that accounts for interactions among different types of urban landscape surfaces. We suggest that this approach can support spatial prioritization of landscape function needs in urban development and design approaches for improving particular types of functioning, such as reductions in urban heat.},

Time series (TS) analysis of remote sensing images is a powerful method for land use change detection. To address the complexity of sample selection and the salt-and-pepper noise of pixels, we propose a bidirectional segmented detection (BSD) method based on object-level, multivariate TS, that detects the type and time of land use change from Landsat images. In the proposed method, based on the multiresolution segmentation of objects, three dimensions of object-level TS are constructed using the median of the following indices: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference built index (NDBI), and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI). Then, BSD with forward and backward detection is performed on the segmented objects to identify the types and times of land use change. Experimental results indicate that the proposed BSD method effectively detects the type and time of land use change with an overall accuracy of 90.49\% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.86. It was also observed that the median value of a segmented object is more representative than the commonly used mean value. In addition, compared with traditional methods such as LandTrendr, the proposed method is competitive in terms of time efficiency and accuracy. Thus, the BSD method can promote efficient and accurate land use change detection.},

The results indicate that, contrary to most other studies, land configuration has a stronger influence on LST than land composition. In addition, both land configuration and architecture combined with cadastral, demographic, and economic variables, capture a significant amount of explained variance in LST.

  abstract = {Wetlands are one of the most important ecosystems that provide a desirable habitat for a great variety of flora and fauna. Wetland mapping and modeling using Earth Observation (EO) data are essential for natural resource management at both regional and national levels. However, accurate wetland mapping is challenging, especially on a large scale, given their heterogeneous and fragmented landscape, as well as the spectral similarity of differing wetland classes. Currently, precise, consistent, and comprehensive wetland inventories on a national- or provincial-scale are lacking globally, with most studies focused on the generation of local-scale maps from limited remote sensing data. Leveraging the Google Earth Engine (GEE) computational power and the availability of high spatial resolution remote sensing data collected by Copernicus Sentinels, this study introduces the first detailed, provincial-scale wetland inventory map of one of the richest Canadian provinces in terms of wetland extent. In particular, multi-year summer Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 and optical Sentinel-2 data composites were used to identify the spatial distribution of five wetland and three non-wetland classes on the Island of Newfoundland, covering an approximate area of 106,000 km2. The classification results were evaluated using both pixel-based and object-based random forest (RF) classifications implemented on the GEE platform. The results revealed the superiority of the object-based approach relative to the pixel-based classification for wetland mapping. Although the classification using multi-year optical data was more accurate compared to that of SAR, the inclusion of both types of data significantly improved the classification accuracies of wetland classes. In particular, an overall accuracy of 88.37\% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.85 were achieved with the multi-year summer SAR/optical composite using an object-based RF classification, wherein all wetland and non-wetland classes were correctly identified with accuracies beyond 70\% and 90\%, respectively. The results suggest a paradigm-shift from standard static products and approaches toward generating more dynamic, on-demand, large-scale wetland coverage maps through advanced cloud computing resources that simplify access to and processing of the “Geo Big Data.” In addition, the resulting ever-demanding inventory map of Newfoundland is of great interest to and can be used by many stakeholders, including federal and provincial governments, municipalities, NGOs, and environmental consultants to name a few.},

Issues considered include the choice of algorithm, training data requirements, user-defined parameter selection and optimization, feature space impacts and reduction, and computational costs.

Solar reflective pavement has been praised as simple, low-cost solution with a demonstrated ability to reduce surface temperature. Less well understood is the effect of solar reflective coatings on radiant heat, which influences human thermal exposure and comfort. We present the first biometeorological observations of solar reflective coating to investigate its thermal performance from a pedestrian perspective. Hourly transects were conducted in two Los Angeles neighborhoods with MaRTy, a mobile platform that measures air, surface, and mean radiant temperature. Transects were performed on July 30, 2019, a typical summer day with low wind speeds and maximum air temperature of 31 °C. The surface temperature of coated asphalt concrete was 4 °C to 6 °C lower than that of regular asphalt concrete, but coated surfaces reflected 118 Wm−2 more shortwave radiation on average and up to 168 Wm−2 more at noon. In the evening, MaRTy observed 20 to 30 Wm−2 of added reflected shortwave radiation on sidewalks next to the reflective pavement. Mean radiant temperature over reflective pavement was 4 °C higher during midday. Although air temperature was reduced by 0.5 °C in the afternoon, after-sunset cooling was negligible. Findings illustrate the benefits and disadvantages of reflective pavement with respect to various thermal performance metrics. Cities should weigh the tradeoffs of UHI mitigation, thermal exposure, implementation and maintenance costs, lifecycle, and other competing priorities in the context of space use.},

This study investigates the impact of the City's heat mitigation strategies on daytime microclimate for a pre-monsoon summer day under current climate conditions and two climate change scenarios. We assessed the cooling effect of trees and cool roofs in a Phoenix residential neighborhood using the microclimate model ENVI-met. First, using xeric landscaping as a base, we created eight tree planting scenarios (from 0\% canopy cover to 30\% canopy cover) for the neighborhood to characterize the relationship between canopy cover and daytime cooling benefit of trees. In a second set of simulations, we ran ENVI-met for nine combined tree planting and landscaping scenarios (mesic, oasis, and xeric) with regular roofs and cool roofs under current climate conditions and two climate change projections. For each of the 54 scenarios, we compared average neighborhood mid-afternoon air temperatures and assessed the benefits of each heat mitigation measure under current and projected climate conditions. Findings suggest that the relationship between percent canopy cover and air temperature reduction is linear, with 0.14°C cooling per percent increase in tree cover for the neighborhood under investigation. An increase in tree canopy cover from the current 10\% to a targeted 25\% resulted in an average daytime cooling benefit of up to 2.0°C in residential neighborhoods at the local scale. Cool roofs reduced neighborhood air temperatures by 0.3°C when implemented on residential homes. The results from this city-specific mitigation project will inform messaging campaigns aimed at engaging the city decision makers, industry, and the public in the green building and urban forestry initiatives.},

  abstract = {The continued increase in average and extreme temperatures around the globe is expected to strike urban communities more harshly because of the urban heat island (UHI). Devising natural and design-based solutions to stem the rising heat has become an important urban planning issue. Recent studies have examined the impacts of 2D/3D urban land-use structures on land surface temperature (LST), but with little attention to the shades cast by 3D objects, such as buildings and trees. It is, however, known that shades are particularly relevant for controlling summertime temperatures. This study examines the role of urban shades created by trees and buildings, focusing on the effects of shade extent and location on LST mitigation. A realistic 3D digital representation of urban and suburban landscapes, combined with detailed 2D land cover information, is developed. Shadows projected on horizontal and vertical surfaces are obtained through GIS analysis, and then quantified as independent variables explaining LST variations over grids of varying sizes with spatial regression models. The estimation results show that the shades on different 3D surfaces, including building rooftops, sun-facing façades, not-sun-facing façades, and on 2D surfaces including roadways, other paved covers, and grass, have cooling effects of varying impact, showing that shades clearly modify the thermal effects of urban built-up surfaces. Tree canopy volume has distinct effects on LST via evapotranspiration. One of the estimated models is used, after validation, to simulate the LST impacts of neighborhood scenarios involving additional greening. The findings illustrate how urban planners can use the proposed methodology to design 3D land-use solutions for effective heat mitigation.},

  abstract = {The thermal environment in residential areas is directly related to the living quality of residents. Therefore, it is important to understand thermal heterogeneity and ways to regulate temperature in residential neighborhoods. We investigated the spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of air temperatures in 20 residential neighborhoods within the 5th ring road of Beijing, China. We further explored how the variations in air temperature were related to the patterns of the surrounding greenspace at different scales. We found that: (1) large air temperature differences existed among residential neighborhoods, with hourly maximum differences in air temperature reaching 5.30 °C on hot summer days; (2) not only the percentage but also the spatial configuration (e.g., edge density) of greenspace affected the local air temperature; and (3) the effects of spatial greenspace patterns on air temperature were scale dependent and varied by season. For example, increasing the proportion of greenspace in surrounding areas within a 100-m radius and increasing the edge density within radii from 500 to 1000 m could lower air temperatures in summer but not affect air temperatures in winter. In addition, decreasing the edge density of greenspaces within a 100-m radius of the surrounding areas would lead to an increase in air temperature in winter but not affect the air temperature in summer. These results extend our understanding of thermal environments and their relationships with greenspace patterns at the microscale (i.e., residential neighborhoods). They also provide useful information for urban planners to optimize greenspace patterns under better thermal conditions at the neighborhood scale.},

  abstract = {The availability and accessibility of multispectral and radar satellite remote sensing (SRS) imagery are at an unprecedented high. These data have both become standard source of information for investigating species ecology and ecosystems structure, composition and function at large scales. Since they capture complementary aspects of the Earth's surface, synergies between these two types of imagery have the potential to greatly expand research and monitoring opportunities. However, despite the benefits of combining multispectral and radar SRS data, data fusion techniques, including image fusion, are not commonly used in biodiversity monitoring, ecology and conservation. To help close this application gap, we provide for the first time an overview of the most common SRS data fusion techniques, discussing their benefits and drawbacks, and pull together case studies illustrating the added value for biodiversity research and monitoring. Integrating and fusing multispectral and radar images can significantly improve our ability to assess the distribution as well as the horizontal and vertical structure of ecosystems. Additionally, SRS data fusion has the potential to increase opportunities for mapping species distribution and community composition, as well as for monitoring threats to biodiversity. Uptake of these techniques will benefit from more effective collaboration between remote sensing and biodiversity experts, making the reporting of methodologies more transparent, expanding SRS image processing capacity and promoting widespread open access to satellite imagery. In the context of a global biodiversity crisis, being able to track subtle changes in the biosphere across adequate spatial and temporal extents and resolutions is crucial. By making key parameter estimates derived from SRS data more accurate, SRS data fusion promises to become a powerful tool to help address current monitoring needs, and could support the development of essential biodiversity variables.},

It also has great potential in applications in water disaster and water resources. This paper introduces the principle of hyperspectral imaging, summarizes the development of hyperspectral payload at home and abroad, and focuses on the application of hyperspectral remote sensing to solve specific water problems, including monitoring of water bloom and aquatic plants, accurate discrimination of water bloom and water grass, inversion of chlorophyll concentration, quantitative estimation of suspended matter concentration and sediment content, real-time and large-scale flood disaster emergency monitoring, quantitative inversion of land surface hydrological parameters, estimation of evapotranspiration, and so on. In addition, the bottleneck problems in the application of hyperspectral remote sensing in water conservancy industry are summarized and analyzed. With the rapid development of hyperspectral imaging technology and increasing availability of hyperspectral data sources, the application of hyperspectral remote sensing in water conservancy will also enter a new stage. It is necessary to confront the needs of water conservancy industry at the new stage. We should enhance the research on multi-platform hyperspectral water conservancy elements stereoscopic monitoring and integration, construction of the standard spectrum database for typical feature elements in water conservancy, and new methods or new theories for water conservancy hyperspectral remote sensing information intelligent mining.},

  abstract = {The precise correction of atmospheric effects is essential for the accurate analysis of inland water color from remote sensing (RS) data. This study systematically evaluates the efficacy of five atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms—Acolite, C2RCC, FLAASH, iCOR, and L2gen—when applied to Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) imagery. The performance of these algorithms is scrutinized across different spectral bands and spatial resolutions, with a focus on their suitability for water body AC. Our validation approach primarily focuses on the spatial arrangement of sampling points and the timeliness of the collected data. The results reveal that Acolite demonstrates superior performance in the red band of MSI data, whereas C2RCC exhibits inconsistencies in the blue and green bands. FLAASH stands out in its handling of OLCI data, although iCOR exhibits sensitivity to resolution, resulting in over-correction in lower resolution scenarios. L2gen is noted for its consistent provision of concentrated data amplitude across the board. The findings, graphically represented through a radar chart, are pivotal for guiding the selection of optimal AC algorithms for the visible spectrum, thereby enhancing the accuracy of RS applications in environmental monitoring and research. Additionally, our study highlights the impact of sampling time differences on the AC spectrum, with variations of approximately 3\% observed for a single sensor. This underscores the critical need for temporal consistency in field measurements.},

  abstract = {Land cover (LC) and land use (LU) have commonly been classified separately from remotely sensed imagery, without considering the intrinsically hierarchical and nested relationships between them. In this paper, for the first time, a highly novel Joint Deep Learning framework is proposed and demonstrated for LC and LU classification. The proposed Joint Deep Learning (JDL) model incorporates a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN), and is implemented via a Markov process involving iterative updating. In the JDL, LU classification conducted by the CNN is made conditional upon the LC probabilities predicted by the MLP. In turn, those LU probabilities together with the original imagery are re-used as inputs to the MLP to strengthen the spatial and spectral feature representations. This process of updating the MLP and CNN forms a joint distribution, where both LC and LU are classified simultaneously through iteration. The proposed JDL method provides a general framework within which the pixel-based MLP and the patch-based CNN provide mutually complementary information to each other, such that both are refined in the classification process through iteration. Given the well-known complexities associated with the classification of very fine spatial resolution (VFSR) imagery, the effectiveness of the proposed JDL was tested on aerial photography of two large urban and suburban areas in Great Britain (Southampton and Manchester). The JDL consistently demonstrated greatly increased accuracies with increasing iteration, not only for the LU classification, but for both the LC and LU classifications, achieving by far the greatest accuracies for each at around 10 iterations. The average overall classification accuracies were 90.18\% for LC and 87.92\% for LU for the two study sites, far higher than the initial accuracies and consistently outperforming benchmark comparators (three each for LC and LU classification). This research, thus, represents the first attempt to unify the remote sensing classification of LC (state; what is there?) and LU (function; what is going on there?), where previously each had been considered separately only. It, thus, has the potential to transform the way that LC and LU classification is undertaken in future. Moreover, it paves the way to address effectively the complex tasks of classifying LC and LU from VFSR remotely sensed imagery via joint reinforcement, and in an automatic manner. •Joint Deep Learning (JDL) was first proposed for land cover and land use classification.•JDL incorporated patch-based CNN and pixel-based MLP with joint reinforcement and mutual complementarity.•The joint distributions between LC and LU were formulated into a Markov process through iterative updating.•Increased accuracies were achieved for both LC and LU in an automatic fashion with iteration.•The JDL framework is readily generalisable to hierarchical representations at multiple levels and scales.},

We found an obvious urban/rural temperature “cliff” and estimated that the footprint of UHI effect (FP, including urban area) was 2.3 and 3.9 times of urban size for the day and night, respectively, with large spatiotemporal heterogeneities. We further revealed that ignoring the FP may underestimate the UHI intensity in most cases and even alter the direction of UHI estimates for few cities. Our results provide new insights to the characteristics of UHI effect and emphasize the necessity of considering city- and time-specific FP when assessing the urbanization effects on local climate.},

  abstract = {The surface urban heat island (SUHI), which represents the difference of land surface temperature (LST) in urban relativity to neighboring non-urban surfaces, is usually measured using satellite LST data. Over the last few decades, advancements of remote sensing along with spatial science have considerably increased the number and quality of SUHI studies that form the major body of the urban heat island (UHI) literature. This paper provides a systematic review of satellite-based SUHI studies, from their origin in 1972 to the present. We find an exponentially increasing trend of SUHI research since 2005, with clear preferences for geographic areas, time of day, seasons, research foci, and platforms/sensors. The most frequently studied region and time period of research are China and summer daytime, respectively. Nearly two-thirds of the studies focus on the SUHI/LST variability at a local scale. The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are the two most commonly-used satellite sensors and account for about 78\% of the total publications. We systematically reviewed the main satellite/sensors, methods, key findings, and challenges of the SUHI research. Previous studies confirm that the large spatial (local to global scales) and temporal (diurnal, seasonal, and inter-annual) variations of SUHI are contributed by a variety of factors such as impervious surface area, vegetation cover, landscape structure, albedo, and climate. However, applications of SUHI research are largely impeded by a series of data and methodological limitations. Lastly, we propose key potential directions and opportunities for future efforts. Besides improving the quality and quantity of LST data, more attention should be focused on understudied regions/cities, methods to examine SUHI intensity, inter-annual variability and long-term trends of SUHI, scaling issues of SUHI, the relationship between surface and subsurface UHIs, and the integration of remote sensing with field observations and numeric modeling.},
