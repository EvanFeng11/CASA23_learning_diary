## Summary

This week's content focused on atmospheric correction techniques and image enhancement methods for remote sensing data. Atmospheric correction is a critical preprocessing step that removes atmospheric effects from satellite imagery, improving data accuracy by converting raw digital numbers (DN) to reflectance values . We explored several correction methods, including Dark Object Subtraction (DOS), which assumes the darkest pixels should have zero reflectance and attributes their values to atmospheric effects. The mathematical formulation for DOS follows: $\rho_{\lambda}= \frac{(Lsat_{rad} - Lhaze1percent_{rad})\pi * d^2}{EO_{\lambda} * cos\theta S * TUAv + TAUz}$ . For relatively clear Landsat scenes, we can convert radiance to reflectance using: $\rho_{\rho}= \frac{\pi* L_{\lambda} * d ^2}{ESUN_{\lambda} * cos\theta_S}$. In R, these corrections can be implemented using the radCor function from the RStoolbox package.

Additionally, we learned various image enhancement techniques to improve interpretability. These include ratio transformations for highlighting specific features (like NDVI for vegetation), filtering methods (low-pass, high-pass, and median) for noise reduction and edge enhancement, texture analysis using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) to extract spatial structural information, data fusion combining multiple sensor data, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and removal of redundant information . Each technique serves different purposes in remote sensing analysis, and their appropriate application depends on research objectives and data characteristics.

## Applications

Atmospheric correction techniques have been widely applied in urban environmental monitoring studies. Wang et al. (2024) evaluated the effectiveness of five atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms (Acolite, C2RCC, FLAASH, iCOR, and L2gen) applied to Sentinel-2 Multispectral instrument (MSI) and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land color instrument images. Their research demonstrated that proper atmospheric correction significantly improves the accuracy of land cover classification in urban areas, with overall accuracy increasing by up to 15%. The choice of correction algorithm can substantially impact the reliability of subsequent analyses, particularly in regions with complex atmospheric conditions such as urban-industrial areas or locations with frequent cloud cover.

Image enhancement techniques have proven valuable in diverse remote sensing applications. Chen et al. (2012) developed an innovative atmospheric correction approach called ACVSS (Atmospheric Correction based on Vector Space of Spectrum), which improves image quality by first retrieving reflectance images using radiative transfer equations and then constructing a spectrum vector space using infrared bands to correct residual errors in visible bands. Their experiments with Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery demonstrated that this method produced more accurate and visually distinct corrected images compared to popular atmospheric correction software at that time. Their approach highlighted how advanced atmospheric correction techniques can significantly enhance the quality of satellite imagery for subsequent analysis of surface features.

In ecological applications, Schulte to Bühne and Pettorelli (2018) explored the integration of multispectral and radar satellite imagery for biodiversity monitoring, showing how data fusion techniques can overcome the limitations of individual sensors and provide more comprehensive information about habitat structure and condition . Their research highlighted that combining optical and radar data improved the detection of subtle changes in vegetation structure that would be missed by either sensor alone, offering valuable insights for conservation planning in rapidly changing environments.

## Reflection

The techniques learned this week represent fundamental tools in the remote sensing analyst's toolkit, each with specific strengths and limitations. Atmospheric correction, while essential for quantitative analysis, requires careful consideration of atmospheric conditions and sensor characteristics. I found the mathematical foundations particularly challenging but appreciated their importance for ensuring data integrity. The various image enhancement methods offer exciting possibilities for extracting meaningful information from satellite imagery, but their effective application requires a nuanced understanding of both the techniques themselves and the phenomena being studied.

What I found most interesting was how these seemingly technical procedures connect directly to real-world applications in urban planning, environmental monitoring, and conservation. The ability to accurately measure vegetation health in cities or detect subtle changes in forest structure has profound implications for addressing pressing environmental challenges. Looking forward, I believe these skills will be valuable in my future work, particularly the combination of spectral and textural analysis for complex landscape characterization. However, I recognize that remote sensing is just one tool among many, and its integration with field data and local knowledge is essential for developing holistic understanding of environmental systems.
